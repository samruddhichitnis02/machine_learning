1. Title: HIV-1 protease cleavage data

2. Source Information
   
   -- The data consists of four (4) different data sets: the 746 data;
      the 1625 data; the Schilling data; and the Impens data.

5. Number of instances
   - 746 data: 746 
   - 1625 data: 1625 
   - Schilling data: 3272 
   - Impens data: 947 

6. Number of attributes

   There are only two attributes: a 8 letter string (octamer) and a label that tells whether this
   string represents a site in a peptide (or protein) where the HIV-1 protease cleaves it (+1 if yes, -1 if no). 
   The 8 letter string can also be viewed as 8 independent attributes. It is common to map the 8 letters
   to an orthogonal binary representation; a matrix with 160 elements. 
   
7. Attributes

   There are 20 allowed letters in the 8 character string (the allowed alphabet): 'ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV'
   These represent amino acids.
   The cleavage label has only two possible values: -1 and +1.

8. Missing values

   There are no missing values
   
9. Class distributions

   - 746 data: 401 cleaved, 345 non-cleaved
   - 1625 data: 374 cleaved, 1251 non-cleaved
   - Schilling data: 434 cleaved, 2838 non-cleaved
   - Impens data: 149 cleaved, 798 non-cleaved
